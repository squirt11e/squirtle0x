# My Web3 Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio site, a unique fusion of a personal portfolio and an interactive Web3 application. This site showcases my PFP, articles from Mirror, and my social accounts. But it doesn't stop there - you can connect your own wallet and see your content in its place!

## Features

- **ENS Name**: Connect your wallet, and it will display your own ENS name (if available for your wallet).
- **NFT PFP Display**: The site features an NFT display that initially showcases my PFP. Connect your Ethereum wallet, and it will display your NFT PFP (if available for your wallet).
- **Mirror Articles**: Explore my thoughts and insights on the crypto space in articles published on Mirror. If you have your own Mirror account connected with your ENS domain, your articles will be displayed instead.

## Connect Your Wallet

Want to see your content displayed on the site? Follow these steps:

1. Click on the "Connect Wallet" button.
2. Approve the connection in your wallet.
3. If your ENS domain has associated Name, PFP, and Mirror articles, you'll see them displayed on the site.

If you don't see your content, it might be because your ENS domain isn't set up correctly. To learn more about setting up your ENS domain, check out these Mirror articles:

## Technologies Used

This portfolio site is built with React, Next.js, TypeScript, and uses the Ethereum blockchain for Web3 functionality.
